# Convex_hull_sum

## Aim :
Implement a solution for Finding a summation of elements from a matrix.
Example: Accept a 2D matrix dimension. Populate using random number [non-zero]

Accept any five dimension values from the user  
Check the region covered by these points in the matrix.
Calculate the boundary by either considering all points or ignoring few points which may not come on boundary [convex hull]
Find sum of elements in the region.



***We have used vector to make the array dynamic and for ease in creating a matrix of desired dimentions***

###### step 1 : Creating a Matrix

###### step 1 : Accepting the dimentions of polygon
###### step 2 : Eliminating the incorrect dimentions
###### step 3 : Travering each point throughout the matrix within max and min ranges of polygon dimentions
###### step 4 : checking whether the point lies inside the polygon
###### step 5 : Implementing step 4 using isInside,doIntersect,orientation,onSegment functions
###### step 6 : By evaluating the result generated by step 5 we add the element of the matrix to variable sum
###### step 7 : Printing the sum
